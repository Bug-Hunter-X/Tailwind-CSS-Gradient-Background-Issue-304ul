# Tailwind CSS Gradient Background Issue

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered while using Tailwind CSS gradient backgrounds. The gradient doesn't render correctly, resulting in an unexpected visual outcome. The solution shows how to address this problem.

## Bug

The original code uses `bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-500 to-purple-500` to create a gradient from blue to purple.  However, the gradient is not applied correctly, or there is another rendering issue. This might be due to incorrect configuration, conflicting CSS, or other factors.

## Solution

The solution addresses the issue by [description of the fix, e.g., ensuring the correct Tailwind CSS configuration is in place or resolving CSS conflicts]. The corrected code ensures the gradient is rendered as expected.
